# Learning Rock Pushability on Rough Planetary Terrain

This repository contains the ROS2 implementation for the research paper "Learning Rock Pushability on Rough Planetary Terrain," presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics. Please refer to the paper for further detail.

## Core Concepts

This work moves beyond traditional avoidance by actively manipulating the environment. Key concepts include:

* **Affordance Learning:** The robot learns the "affordance" of an obstacleâ€”what actions it offers. Specifically, can it be pushed?
* **Exteroceptive & Proprioceptive Feedback:** The system combines visual cues (size, shape, terrain slope) with physical force feedback from pushing the object to make a decision.
* **Probabilistic Framework:** The decision of whether an obstacle can be relocated is based on a probabilistic model, accounting for the uncertainties of unstructured environments.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as a collection of ROS2 Humble packages within a `src` directory.

* `boeing_interfaces`: Contains custom ROS2 message (`.msg`) and service (`.srv`) definitions used for communication between the different nodes in the system.
* `boeing_vision`: This package is responsible for the visual perception pipeline. It likely handles obstacle detection, localization, and analysis of the surrounding terrain from camera data.
* **[Coming Soon]**: A third package for Gazebo simulation will be added.
